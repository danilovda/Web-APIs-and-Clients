# Web-APIs-and-Clients

Welcome to the "Web-APIs-and-Clients" repository! The goal of this project is to see how client and server work together using different programming languages and technologies.

## Repository Structure

The project consists of two main parts: the server-side (Web API) and the client-side (Client).

### Web API

The Web API is implemented in three different languages:

1. **C# with ASP.NET Core:** This is built on the .NET platform for creating high-performance web applications.

2. **Node.js with Express:** A JavaScript example for server-side development.

3. **Python with Flask:** A simple Web API implementation in Python for exploring its capabilities.

### Client

The client-side is implemented using two different technologies:

1. **Angular:** The client is written using Angular, a popular framework for creating dynamic web applications.

2. **ASP.NET Core MVC:** Another client implementation, but on the .NET platform using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danilovda/Web-APIs-and-Clients.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For each Web API, go into the respective directory (e.g., `dotnet-api`, `node-api`, `python-api`) and follow the instructions in the README.
   - For each client, go into the respective directory (e.g., `angular-client`, `mvc-client`) and follow the instructions in the README.

3. **Run the projects:**
   - Start each Web API and client separately following the instructions in their respective directories.

4. **Explore and Compare:**
   - Dive into the code, compare the approaches to problem-solving in different languages and technologies.

## Additional Information

- Each directory contains its own README with instructions on how to run, dependencies, and other useful information.
- The project is provided "as-is" without warranties. Feel free to use it for educational or exploratory purposes.
